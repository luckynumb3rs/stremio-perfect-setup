# 🎬 STREMIO FULL & EASY TOTAL BEGINNER'S GUIDE

> 🔔 **BIG UPDATES FOR EXISTING GUIDE USERS**
> 
> Since the new version of AIOStreams was just released, with a few new features, I have updated and of course improved my ready-to-use AIOStreams template used in this guide. If you already set up AIOStreams through this guide before this announcement, I would definitely recommend to update to the new template. Instructions are at the end of this post. Also, **VERY IMPORTANT**, for those of you that configured **AIOStreams** and/or **AIOMetadata** on the *ForTheWeak* instances (compare your links with these: [*aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev*](https://aiostreamsfortheweak.nhyira.dev/) and [*aiometadatafortheweak.nhyira.dev*](https://aiometadatafortheweak.nhyira.dev/)), coincidentally it was also announced [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1r0jgzm/fortheweak_domain_migration/) that those instances are being migrated to a new domain, so you're going to have to migrate your AIOStreams & AIOMetadata configurations on the new instances since the ones you used will be closed after a transitory phase. Not to worry though, it's easy. Read at the end of the post.

----------------------------------

After a few iterations trying out what works and what doesn't for me, and testing various add-ons, I think I have reached the optimal Stremio setup. Of course it's a matter of taste and everyone has different preferences, but I will share my guide here for anyone interested, or at least get started easily and then modify in reverse whatever changes they want. So here it is completely from scratch:

**Don't be scared. Although it may look like a very long guide, it's actually just a few simple steps and very easy. I just wanted to be thorough and describe everything totally step-by-step so you understand what you're doing.**

**NOTES**:
* *If you are a total beginner and are curious to understand more how Stremio ecosystem works and the concepts around it, go to **Beginner Concepts**.*
* *If you already followed this guide and are encountering issues or have configuration questions, go to **Configuration Q&A**. If you're just starting, remember this for later in case you need it.*

In case you are wondering whether it's worth the effort, or you already have a Torrentio + RD setup and want to know what's better if you use this guide, here's a summary:

* **Cleaner Management**: instead of one scraper and a messy pile of addons, you use *two central addons* (AIOStreams + AIOMetadata) to keep everything *clean, consistent, and easy to manage*.
* **Better Results**: AIOStreams combines *multiple scrapers/providers*, so you usually get *more working sources* and better coverage.
* **Best Links First**: smart *sorting + filtering* pushes the most relevant options to the top (cache, quality, resolution, size, reliability signals), so less scrolling and fewer bad clicks.
* **Extra Quality Signals**: on top of general sorting, *Vidhin's regexes* help *rate/identify quality releases and trusted groups* for even better ordering.
* **Cleaner Source Selection UI**: a *minimal, modern stream list view* with the info you actually need to choose fast.
* **Netflix-like Automation**: Trakt-driven *personal lists, watch tracking, and progress syncing* and a *full-blown suggestions engine with dynamic catalogs* based on what you watch and like, for a more "recommended and organized" experience.
* **Richer Browsing**: AIOMetadata gives *better catalogs + metadata integrations* (ratings, descriptions, artwork) and lets you *remove/replace Cinemeta clutter*.

So, now that you know, it's up to you, but if you're up for it, let's do it:

**Since a few of you have asked about tipping me for helping**: I prepared the guide because I did it so so many times and I realized there are a lot of people that are not doing it just because they need to learn a lot of things in order to get a good working setup. I'm really happy that my guide has been so useful, I really wasn't expecting it to gain so much traction. So I created [**this**](https://ko-fi.com/luckynumb3rs) link where you can tip if you feel like doing so, but I'm very happy you can enjoy Stremio either way!

I hope you like my configuration, but of course you can modify it any way you want. I had to set it up for a few friends lately, so I got my process streamlined now and I though I would share it to maybe help anyone struggling with the many options for configuring the best stream platform in the world: **STREMIO**.

**A special thanks** to the Stremio developers, and all the add-on developers that allow us to enjoy these, it's amazing how this solution exists among all the fragmentation among subscription services which has become very annoying even if you have all the money in the world.
