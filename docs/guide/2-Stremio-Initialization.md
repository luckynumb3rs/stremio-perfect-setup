# 🔧 2. Stremio Account Initialization

Second, let's prepare the Stremio account properly:

1. Open [**Stremio Web**](https://web.stremio.com) and **MAKE SURE** you're signed in with your account.
   * **IMPORTANT**: *Do not confuse* [*www.stremio.com*](https://www.stremio.com)*, which is for account management, with* [*web.stremio.com*](https://web.stremio.com)*, which you* ***MUST*** *be signed in to for removing/installing the addons. Being signed in to* [*www.stremio.com*](https://www.stremio.com) *does not automatically sign you in to* [*web.stremio.com*](https://web.stremio.com)*, and your addons will not install on your account.*
   * *Obviously you need a browser to configure everything on this guide, including using the* ***Web*** *version of Stremio to remove and install addons. Don't worry though, after you set everything up* ***ONCE***, *you can use your setup everywhere you use Stremio (Smart TV, Android, iOS, Windows, everywhere).*
2. Go to "**Settings**" in [**Stremio Account**](https://www.stremio.com) and enable **Trakt Scrobbling** by connecting it to your Trakt account.
   * *This will allow Stremio to sync show progress and history with Trakt.*
3. Go to "**Addons**" and uninstall all addons.
   * *Also remove the* ***Trakt Integration*** *addon, it is separate from* ***Trakt Scrobbling*** *(which you need), and you don't need it because we will use something else for this.*
   * *Cinemeta and Local Files cannot be removed. Leave them, we will take care of this later.*
